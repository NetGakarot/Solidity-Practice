# Solidity Practice â€“ Topic-wise Smart Contract Learning

Welcome to my Solidity practice repository! ðŸ§   
This repo contains **topic-wise smart contract code** written during my journey to master Solidity and become a smart contract auditor.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

To build strong fundamentals in Solidity by covering each topic through practical smart contract code.  
Every folder in this repo represents a key concept or module in Solidity.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Overview

- `Basic_Concept` â€“ Variables, data types, and basic Solidity syntax
- `contract_structure_and_functions` â€“ Contract skeletons and function visibility
- `Mapping_Struct_Arrays_Enums` â€“ Deep dive into mappings, structs, arrays, and enums
- `control_flow&logic` â€“ If-else, loops, and other control structures
- `custom_try_catch_errors` â€“ Error handling with `require`, `revert`, `assert`, and `try-catch`
- `payable_function_ether_sending_ways` â€“ Payable functions, `send`, `transfer`, `call`
- `storage_memory_call` â€“ Data location and memory/storage management
- `Events` â€“ Event declaration and logging
- `Abstract_Interfaces` â€“ Abstract contracts and interfaces
- `Inheritance&Polymorphism` â€“ Inheritance and contract polymorphism
- `call_delegate_static` â€“ Low-level function calls: `call`, `delegatecall`, `staticcall`
- `Time_Based_Actions` â€“ Time-dependent conditions using `block.timestamp`
- `Udemy_notes` â€“ Notes and code snippets from learning resources (like Udemy)
